# GLS OF BABYSOC
## POST-SYNTHESIS SIMULATION

### Purpose of GLS:
Gate-Level Simulation is used to verify the functionality of a design after the synthesis process. Unlike behavioral or RTL (Register Transfer Level) simulations, which are performed at a higher level of abstraction, GLS works on the netlist generated post-synthesis. This netlist includes the actual gates and connections used to implement the design.

### Key Aspects of GLS for BabySoC:
1. **Verification with Timing Information:**
   - GLS is performed using Standard Delay Format (SDF) files to ensure timing correctness.
   - This checks if the SoC behaves as expected under real-world timing constraints.

2. **Design Validation Post-Synthesis:**
   - Confirms that the design's logical behavior remains correct after mapping it to the gate-level representation.
   - Ensures that the design is free from issues like metastability or glitches.

3. **Simulation Tools:**
   - Tools like Icarus Verilog or a similar simulator can be used for compiling and running the gate-level netlist.
   - Waveforms are typically analyzed using GTKWave.

4. **Importance for BabySoC:**
   - BabySoC consists of multiple modules like the RISC-V processor, PLL, and DAC. GLS ensures that these modules interact correctly and meet the timing requirements in the synthesized design.
